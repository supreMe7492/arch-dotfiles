# Arch Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for **Hyprland**, **Neovim**, **kitty**, **Rofi**, **Starship**, **Waypaper**, and custom scripts like **floatpopup**.

> ⚠️ Most of these configs are adapted from existing sources.  
> Hyprland setup copied from: [Hyprpine Dots](https://github.com/alokftww/hyprpine-dots)  
> SDDM theme copied from: [Astronaut Theme](https://github.com/Keyitdev/sddm-astronaut-theme)

## Notes

- Some files/scripts are copied as-is from other sources, with minor modifications (mostly shortcuts or tweaks).
- I do **not** stow my SDDM setup; see the link above if you want it.
- Floatpopup and Waypaper scripts are included; they require proper permissions (`chmod +x`) to run.
