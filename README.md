# My Arch Dotfiles Setup

This repository contains my personal Arch Linux configuration files for **Hyprland**, **Rofi**, **Kitty**, **Neovim**, **Starship**, and other tools I use daily.

> ⚠️ Most of these configs are copied/adapted from awesome sources, with a few custom tweaks like shortcuts and appearance changes.

## How to Use / Transfer to Another Device

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
      git clone git@github.com:supreMe7492/arch-dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles

   ```
